# Ecommerce-sales-analysis
SQL project analyzing e-commerce sales data to provide insights into product performance, regional revenue, customer behavior, and shipping performance.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL-based analysis of an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to answer key business questions to provide actionable insights into product performance, regional revenue, customer behavior, and shipping performance.
This project was created as part of my portfolio to showcase SQL skills in data analysis and storytelling.

1. **Understanding the Business Request**:
   - Analyze the given dataset to answer key business questions.
   - Focus on insights that could drive decision-making.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported the dataset into MySQL Workbench.
   - Addressed missing values (e.g., regions with missing data were updated to `'unknown'`).
3. **SQL Analysis**:
   - Used SQL queries to answer business questions related to top products, regional performance, and customer trends.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualized the insights using Power BI to create dynamic dashboards for storytelling.
